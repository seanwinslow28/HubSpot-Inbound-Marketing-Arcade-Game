# HubSpot_Inbound_Marketing_Arcade_Game
This game is meant to help anyone have a little fun while learning from the HubSpot Academy. Dive into an Inbound Marketing certificate at HubSpot Academy and use this as a fun way to test yourself!

I created this through prompts on Google Gemini. I first asked for a prompt. "Give me a prompt that will best describe how to create an arcade game out of this document that I've attached. I need it to help me learn the HubSpot Inbound Marketing Fundamentals. I'd like the color scheme of the game to be the same color of the HubSpot Website interface attached. Orange and navy blue. I'd like it to have a retro look and, if possible, I'd like it to have retro 80's music." 
Gemini responded with this prompt: "Create a detailed concept for a retro arcade game based on the HubSpot Inbound Marketing Fundamentals. The game should be designed to teach players the core principles of inbound marketing, including the Attract, Engage, and Delight stages, buyer personas, and the buyer's journey.

Describe the gameplay mechanics for each stage, explaining how they relate to the inbound methodology. For example:
- How does the "Attract" stage translate into gameplay? (e.g., collecting valuable content pieces, avoiding distractions)
- How does the "Engage" stage work? (e.g., interacting with prospects, nurturing leads)
- What challenges and goals are involved in the "Delight" stage? (e.g., providing excellent customer service, turning customers into promoters)

The game should have a distinct retro arcade visual style, similar to games from the 1980s, and primarily use the orange and navy blue color scheme found in the attached HubSpot website interface.

Suggest ideas for:
- Player character(s) and enemy/obstacle types (representing marketing challenges).
- Level design, with stages corresponding to the inbound flywheel[cite: 8, 12, 16].
- Power-ups or special abilities related to inbound marketing tools or strategies (e.g., SEO boosts, content creation bonuses, automation power-ups)[cite: 102, 104, 106, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 116, 117, 120].
- Scoring system tied to successful inbound marketing actions.
- A storyline or theme that ties into the concept of attracting and retaining customers by creating valuable content and tailored experiences[cite: 6].

Additionally, describe how retro 80's style music could be integrated into the game's soundtrack to enhance the arcade feel."

I had Gemini code this prompt for me, but it wasn't what I was looking for. It ended up being a buggy Space Invaders type of game. I asked it to simplify the prompt and create a multiple choice question and answer game. I included the Slides from the Inbound Marketing course at HubSpot Academy.

It coded the game that you see here. I copied the code and added my own sound effects and music with Artlist.IO and put it into the code. 

This was the end result. I hope you enjoy!
